# Crystals Collector

Guessing games. Amirite? Sure, they're common projects for beginners. But I still personalized mine as much as I had time to do.

In addition to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I created my game using:

* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts -- Raleway & Risque specificallyBootstrap
* jQuery

This is my first project using jQuery, which I really enjoyed working with. I've always appreciated the clarity and consistency inherant in CSS, so I look forward to using jQuery much more due to its similarities.

I learned so much creating this game ... how to create and use random numbers, reusing functions, fine-tuning my code to reduce redundancy, using jQuery breaks, and more.
