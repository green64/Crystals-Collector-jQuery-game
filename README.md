# Crystals Collector
[Crystals Collector](https://green64.github.io/week-4-game/)

Guessing games. Amirite? Sure, they're common projects for beginners. But in my case it was a good opportunity to incorporate what I've already learned and venture into jQuery.

**Object**

In my game, the code generates a random number, aka the Magic Number. Every round also generates 4 random crystal values. By clicking those, you add to your score and try to match the Magic Number. The game keeps score, and you use the reset button to play again. 

***Technology used***

In addition to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I created my game using:

* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts -- Raleway & Risque specificallyBootstrap
* jQuery

This is my first project using jQuery, which I really enjoyed working with. I've always appreciated the clarity and consistency inherant in CSS, so I look forward to using jQuery much more due to its similarities.

I learned so much creating this game ... how to create and use random numbers, reuse functions, fine-tune my code to reduce redundancy, use jQuery breaks to debug a results error, and more.
